    Hey! I'm Sam, a software engineer from the UK. I work with Python,
    TypeScript, and Vue.js daily and I have been using Vue.js for over 4 years
    now. I also like to experiment with Go and Serverless technologies like AWS
    SAM.

    In my day job I work for <a href="https://tails.com">Tails.com</a>, a pet
    food company providing tailored dog and cat food. In my spare time I build
    projects with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/josephraoreilly">Joe</a
    > under the name Enteka Software.

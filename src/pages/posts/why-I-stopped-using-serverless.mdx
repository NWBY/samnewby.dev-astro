If you follow me on Twitter or know me in person, you will know I love Serverless architecture. Not the serverless framework but serverless
architecture deployed to AWS Lambda. Over the past few years I've been building multiple successful and unsuccessful side projects using
with serverless and I've always ignored the headaches as I told myself that the upside of "pay for what you use" and autoscaling was worth
dealing with the downsides.

### I've had enough

EnaLog is built completely with serverless and deployed using AWS SAM, don't get me wrong SAM takes away a lot of the headaches with serverless
and makes deployment a breeze. But, there are a number of things that I don't want to keep battling:
1. Cold starts - I can battle these with AWS EventBridge rules to keep a container warm to reduce cold starts but this just means more
infrastructure to handle, manage and setup.
2. Warm starts - even with warm starts the responses were still slower than what I could get from a FastAPI app hosted in a container on
AWS. Warm starts on EnaLog are anywhere between 80-400ms, whereas a response for EnaUpload which is FastAPI hosted in a container is
consistently less than 50ms.
3. DX - the developer experience is subpar at best. Since the AWS SAM CLI runs a Flask app which then runs each function in the a Docker
container it doesn't perform very well. We commonly saw 8s+ response times when working locally. CORS also just doesn't work properly
and you have to run a botched local version of CORS functions to get it to work.

### Introducing Containers

Yes, they are not new and yes I've used them before. I decided to build new projects with FastAPI and deploy them in containers. And even
with 0.5vCPU and 1GB of RAM they consistently outperform the serverless projects.

Deploying in a containerised environment to AWS doesn't solve everything, there is still some headaches around CI/CD which I have to
configure myself now. I can't just run `sam deploy` anymore, but this isn't a big deal and for the better DX it's a tradeoff I'm willing
to make.

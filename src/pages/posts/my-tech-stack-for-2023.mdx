I've been a full-time software engineer for over 4 years now, which places me somewhere in the scale of mid-level developer, I think.
In that time I've used a number of different technologies, in terms of languages I've worked with PHP, Go, Python, and JavaScript.
I've worked with frameworks such as Laravel, Flask and Vue.js. And in my spare time I've also spent a lot of time learning 
technologies that really interest me. I really like learning about Serverless technologies and emerging tech such as Astro.

### The 2023 Stack

My tech stack of choice for 2023 is:
* Python - I'll be writing all my APIs and server side logic in Python as since I moved to it last year I've completely fallen in love with it
* AWS SAM - which I'll be using to build and deploy serverless APIs on AWS
* Vue.js - the GOAT of the front-end for me. I've been using it for over 4 years and have never imagined using anything else
* Vite - the build tool we all need. Fast, simple and it just works, the perfect tool for building Vue.js projects
* TailwindCSS - I've been using it for a couple of years now since before version 1 and have found myself in such a productive state with it, that it's used in all my projects
* Astro - this one is fairly new to me, and I'll be using it to build blogs like this one and landing pages that really need to just be static with a sprinkle of JS 
* PostgreSQL - my database of choice, powerful, fast and very close to the full SQL spec

I've set myself a goal of building and launching six projects this year and the tech stack above is what I'll be using for every project.
At the end of the year I plan to write a summary of this tech stack, how it went for me and what I'll be carrying on with into 2024.

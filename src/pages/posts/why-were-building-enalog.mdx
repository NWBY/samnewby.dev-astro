At the beginning of March, we (Joe and I) launched our first SaaS product: [EnaLog](https://enalog.app). I want to address why we're
building EnaLog and what problem it solves.

### What is EnaLog?

It's probably a good idea to start by understanding what EnaLog actually is. It's a simple yet powerful event tracking tool for 
products, SaaS, and business. If you're not sure what event tracking is take a look at 
[this post](https://enalog.app/blog/why-your-saas-needs-event-tracking/) on our blog. But we have big plans to make EnaLog into a
complete analytics tool with feature flags, A/B testing and lot's of other features.

### Why are we building it?

Joe and I are both Software Engineers, we used to work at the same company and now work at different companies but in our experience
we have seen that businesses struggle to know what is actually happening within their product and business. This is due to most modern
companies using a variety of tools and systems, they also don't know what is happening within their product and what their users are
doing when using their product.

So the question we have both asked ourselves a lot of the time when being tasked with building a new feature or implementing a new
piece of tech is why are we doing this? What data has been used to support this decision? Unfortunately, the answer a lot of the time
isn't supported by data. How can an engineering team build a new feature if we don't even know if our users want it?

We have built EnaLog to solve this exact problem. EnaLog allows it's users to track anything and everything in their product and
business so that they can make data driven decisions on what to do next.

Let's look at an example. Your product designer has redesigned your product's onboarding flow to match the product's new branding 
and the engineering team is now been tasked with implementing the  new design. The previous design had 3 steps in the onboarding
process after signup:

* User creates team
* User invites team members to the team
* User completes onboarding by entering their credit card details

Step 1 and step 3 are compulsory but step 2 is optional as your users can always invite their team members at a later 
stage so there is a button to skip step 2. With event tracking from EnaLog your designer has noticed that 95% of new users skip the
second step to invite team members so they decide to remove it in the new onboarding designs which makes the flow simpler and easier
for the engineering team to implement.

Without event tracking powered by EnaLog your engineering team would have implemented the new design with step 2 which is rarely used, 
wasting valuable engineering time and would have made the onboarding flow more complex for no reason.

### Wrapping up

I think that covers why we're building EnaLog pretty well so that's it for this post. If you would like to give EnaLog a try it's free
to [sign up](https://dash.enalog.app/signup) and no credit card required. And if you have any questions or feedback I'd love to hear 
them so please email me at sam@enalog.app

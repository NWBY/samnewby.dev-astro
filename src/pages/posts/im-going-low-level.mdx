I've been working full stack with higher level languages like PHP and Python for nearly 5 years now. I've spent
a little bit of time with Go which I personally place on a medium level somewhere between the low level languages
like C and C++ and the high level like Python and PHP. I've tinkered with low level languages such as Rust and 
spent a couple of months writing C back at University but I want to go back and spend some time really learning
and building with C and C++.

### But why?

As I said I spent a small amount of time writing C, but I don't think I ever properly understood the language
and would build programs that had these predefined parameters set out by the professor. I didn't have to actually
think about how the program would work, design it, or even really research how to build it. So I want to go back
to the lower levels, learn C and properly learn it this time and test myself on how to build stuff with C.

### What I'm going to build?

I'm going to start with a couple of simple programs that just read user input, and do a bunch of menial tasks.
These programs will just help me learn the syntax and features of C. After that the plan is to build a small
executable which can help me track system usage and ping the data back to a REST API, I know there are already
a million of these type of tools out there but it will be interesting to learn.

Following on from that I want to build some sort of GUI with GTK which seems like the de facto framework for
build GUIs with C. After that, who knows? I haven't planned that far ahead. The plan is to open source all the 
code I write and push it to my GitHub.
